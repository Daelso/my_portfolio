# Title: My Portfolio.

## Description:
This homework was to create a portfolio showing off some of our previous works.

I built this project to learn more about webpages, html, css and to improve my skills. I learned a good bit about spacing and designing for different screensizes.

I got to play around with a lot of different positioning tools in CSS and html which was fun and educative. 

The most difficult part by far was getting things to look nice on both mobile and desktop. I also got to experiment with things like backgrounds images, turning images into links and using span classes and a classes.

## Usage 
Click index.html.
