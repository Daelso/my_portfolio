# Title: My Portfolio.

## Description:
This homework was to create a portfolio showing off some of our previous works.

I built this project to learn more about webpages, html, css and to improve my skills. I learned a good bit about spacing and designing for different screensizes.

I learned a good bit about css parent/child relationships and the evils of div. I was also not aware that semantic html had any effect on SEO, apparently it does!

The code is a good bit cleaner/more readable now while maintaining the same functionality.

## Usage 
Click index.html.
